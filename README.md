# Hi, I'm Dakota Leahy 

**IT Student | Navy Veteran | Database Enthusiast | Aspiring Backend & Cloud Developer**

I'm transitioning into tech after years of hands-on work in the U.S. Navy, retail leadership, FedEx delivery, and heavy mechanical/maintenance roles.  
My strength has always been systems thinking — understanding how things fit together, improving processes, and fixing what’s broken.  

Now I apply those same instincts to **software, databases, and backend architecture**.

## 🔧 What I’m Working On
### **Voyager Starship Database (LCARS Project)**
A long-term portfolio project recreating a fully interactive, LCARS-themed starship database inspired by *Star Trek: Voyager*.  
Includes:
- MySQL relational schema  
- Crew dossiers, replicator logs, transporter logs, incident reports  
- First-contact records & scientific anomalies  
- Role-based evaluations & duty logs  
- Future full-stack UI with LCARS theming  

*(This project demonstrates database design, SQL, backend logic, UI concepts, and API planning.)*

### **Stardate Converter (Java)**
A Java application that converts Earth dates into Trek-style stardates.  
My first GitHub project — structured, documented, and ready to showcase.

##  What I’m Learning Right Now
- **Java & Python** foundations  
- **MySQL + SQL schema design**  
- **Git & GitHub workflows**  
- **Cloud concepts: Azure & AWS**  
- **APIs (RESTful design, backend patterns)**  
- **Building a portfolio-ready full-stack app**

---

##  Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** Java, Python, SQL  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, GitHub  
- **Databases:** MySQL  
- **Cloud (in progress):** Azure, AWS  
- **Other:** Markdown, Command Line, JSON, ERD modeling

##  Career Direction
I'm building toward roles in:

- **IT Support → Systems Administration**  
- **Database Administration → Data Engineering**  
- **Backend Development**  
- **Cloud Engineering (Azure/AWS)**  

My goal is a stable career where I *think, build, and solve problems* — not just grind through another job.

##  Fun Fact
I’m turning my love of *Star Trek* into a hands-on learning journey — building systems a real starship might use, one table and function at a time.
